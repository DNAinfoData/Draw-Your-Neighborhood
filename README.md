# Draw-Your-Neighborhood

In 2015 we asked DNAinfo readers in [New York City](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150811/midtown/draw-where-you-think-your-neighborhood-borders-are-on-this-map) and [Chicago](https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150812/wicker-park/draw-your-neighborhood-borders-think-you-know-chicago-time-prove-it) to draw their neighborhood boundaries. More than 39,000 readers responded, giving us a detailed look at how city residents view their neighborhoods. These are their individual drawings in geojson format.

Our initial analysis of neighborhood borders in [New York](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150928/inwood/we-asked-you-draw-your-own-neighborhood-map-heres-what-you-did)  and [Chicago](https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150928/loop/this-is-where-chicagoans-say-borders-of-their-neighborhoods-are) were posted a few weeks after the project started.
